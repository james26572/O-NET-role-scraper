similar tasks. Narrowed 6 fuzzy matching functions to 1. Generated all possible combinations of tasks
pairs between BI analyst and every other occupation in directory. Computed the similarity ratio using the token
set function. Token set ratio removes duplicate words in a string and then computes the fuzz ratio.
We consider token set ratios above the 95th percentile of generated scores for all combinations as similar
tasks.
